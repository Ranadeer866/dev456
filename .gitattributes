Key Reasons for Using pom.xml
Centralized Project Configuration: All project metadata, dependencies, plugins, and build settings are defined in one file.
Automatic Dependency Management: Maven downloads and manages required libraries (and their transitive dependencies) automatically.
Consistent Builds Across Environments: Ensures the same build behavior on different machines, CI pipelines, and production servers.
Standardized Build Lifecycle: Controls phases like compile, test, package, install, and deploy without custom scripts.
Easy Version Control and Maintenance: Dependency versions and plugin configurations can be updated in one place using properties.
Support for Multi-Module Projects: Enables parent–child POMs for managing large, modular applications.
